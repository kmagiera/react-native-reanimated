  "description": "Animated.Code component allows you to define reanimated nodes that you want to execute when their input nodes updates, but aren't necessarily strictly related to some view properties and hence it does not feel right to place them under translate or other prop of an Animated.View. This component renders null, so you can place it in any place you want in your render method. It is required that your code is put inside component as we rely on componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount callbacks to install and cleanup animated nodes. Note that the code you put is going to be executed only once. We currently have no way of telling if your code changes and so it will only be run in componentDidMount. If you wish for your reanimated nodes to be updated when the component updates, you can update the key property of the Animated.Code component, which will effectively unmount old and mount new versions of it in the React tree. You can provide dependencies key which works just like second argueent in useCode.",
