# Getting started

Before you get started you should definitely familiarize yourself with the original Animated API first. Refer to the API description below and to the [Examples](#examples) section to learn how to use this library.

Throughout this document when we refer to classes or methods prefixed with `Animated` we usually refer to them being imported from `react-native-reanimated` package instead of plain `react-native`.


## Installation

I. First install the library from npm repository using `yarn`:
```bash
  yarn add react-native-reanimated
```

II. Link native code with `react-native` cli:
```bash
  react-native link react-native-reanimated
```

III. When you want to use "reanimated" in your project import it from `react-native-reanimated` package:
```js
import Animated from 'react-native-reanimated';
```

Similarly when you need `Easing` import it from `react-native-reanimated` package instead of `react-native`:
```js
import Animated, { Easing } from 'react-native-reanimated';
```
