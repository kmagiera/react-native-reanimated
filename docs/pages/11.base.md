# Lit of base animated nodes 
---

## `set`

```js
set(valueToBeUpdated, sourceNode)
```

When evaluated, it will assign the value of `sourceNode` to the `Animated.Value` passed as a first argument. In other words, it performs an assignment operation from the `sourceNode` to `valueToBeUpdated` value node.

---

## `cond`

```js
cond(conditionNode, ifNode, [elseNode])
```

If `conditionNode` evaluates to "truthy" value the node evaluates `ifNode` node and returns its value, otherwise it evaluates `elseNode` and returns its value. `elseNode` is optional.

---

## `call`

```js
call(argsNodes, callback)
```

If one of the nodes from `argsNodes` array updates, `callback` will be called in JavaScript with a list of current values of nodes from `argsNodes` array as the first argument.

---

## `block`

```js
block([node1, ...])
```

Takes an array of nodes and evaluates all of them in the order they are put in the array. It then returns the value of the last node.

---

## `debug`

```js
debug(messageString, valueNode)
```

When the node is evaluated, it prints a string that contains the `messageString` concatenated with the value of `valueNode`. This then returns the value of `valueNode`. Logs are printed in the JS debugger if it's attached, in console if Expo client is being used, or else in the native console. Logs are visible only in `DEV` mode and have no effect on production builds. Note that `messageString` should be a normal string, not an animated node.

---

## `startClock`

```js
startClock(clockNode)
```

When evaluated, it will make `Clock` node passed as an argument start updating its value each frame. Then returns `0`.

---

## `stopClock`

```js
stopClock(clockNode)
```

When evaluated, it will make `Clock` node passed as an argument stop updating its value (if it has been doing that). Then returns `0`.

---

## `clockRunning`

```js
clockRunning(clockNode)
```

For a given `Clock` node, it returns `1` if the clock [has been started](#startClock) (if it's updating each frame) or returns `0` otherwise.

---

## `event`

Works the same way as with the original `Animated` library.

---

## `add`

```js
add(nodeOrNumber1, nodeOrNumber2, ...)
```

Takes two or more animated nodes or values, and when evaluated, returns their sum.

---

## `sub`

```js
sub(nodeOrNumber1, nodeOrNumber2, ...)
```

Takes two or more animated nodes or values, and when evaluated, returns the result of subtracting their values in the exact order.

---

## `multiply`

```js
multiply(nodeOrNumber1, nodeOrNumber2, ...)
```

Takes two or more animated nodes or values, and when evaluated, returns the result of multiplying their values in the exact order.

---

## `divide`

```js
divide(nodeOrNumber1, nodeOrNumber2, ...)
```

Takes two or more animated nodes or values, and when evaluated, returns the result of dividing their values in the exact order.

---

## `pow`

```js
pow(nodeOrNumber1, nodeOrNumber2, ...)
```

Takes two or more animated nodes or values, and when evaluated, returns the result of first node to the second node power. If more than two nodes are present, the result from the previous step is used as a base and the third node as exponent. This process continues onward for the following nodes if these are present.

---

<!-- TODO - need to explain -->
## `modulo`

```js
modulo(nodeOrNumber, nodeOrNumber)
```

Remainder after division of the first argument by the second one. modulo(a,0) will throw an error.

---
<!-- TODO - need to explain -->
## `sqrt`

```js
sqrt(nodeOrNumber)
```

The square root of the given node. If the number is negative, an error is thrown.

---

## `ceil`

```js
ceil(node)
```

Returns a node that rounds a number upward to its nearest integer. If the passed argument is an integer, the value will not be rounded.

---

## `lessThan`

```js
lessThan(nodeOrValueA, nodeOrValueB)
```

Returns `1` if the value of the first node is less than the value of the second node. Otherwise returns `0`.

---

## `eq`

```js
eq(nodeOrValueA, nodeOrValueB)
```

Returns `1` if the value of both nodes are equal. Otherwise returns `0`.

---

## `greaterThan`

---

## `neq`

```js
neq(nodeOrValueA, nodeOrValueB)
```

Returns `1` if the value of the first node is not equal to the value of the second node. Otherwise returns `0`.

---

## `and`

```js
and(nodeOrValue1, ...)
```

Acts as a logical `AND` operator. Takes one or more nodes as an input and evaluates them in sequence until some node evaluates to a "falsy" value. Then returns that value and stops evaluating further nodes. If all nodes evaluate to a "truthy" it returns the last node's value.

---

## `or`

```js
or(nodeOrValue1, ...)
```

Acts as a logical `OR` operator. Takes one or more nodes as an input and evaluates them in sequence until some node evaluates to a "truthy" value. Then returns that value and stops evaluating further nodes. If all nodes evaluate to a "falsy" value it returns the last node's value.

---

## `defined`

```js
defined(node)
```

Returns `1` if the given node evaluates to a "defined" value (that is to something that is non-null, non-undefined and non-NaN). Returns `0` otherwise.

---

## `not`

---

## `diff`

```js
diff(node)
```

Evaluates node and returns a difference between value returned at the last time it was evaluated and its value at the current time. When evaluating for the first time it returns the node's value.

---

## `acc`

```js
acc(node)
```

Returns an accumulated value of the given node. This node stores a sum of all evaluations of the given node and each time it gets evaluated it would add current node's value to that sum and return it.

---

## `diffClamp`

Works the same way as with the original `Animated` library.

---

## `interpolate`

```js
interpolate(node, {
  // Input range for the interpolation. Should be monotonically increasing.
  inputRange: [nodeOrValue...],
  // Output range for the interpolation, should be the same length as the input range.
  outputRange: [nodeOrValue...],
  // Sets the left and right extrapolate modes.
  extrapolate?: Extrapolate.EXTEND | Extrapolate.CLAMP | Extrapolate.IDENTITY,
  // Set the left extrapolate mode, the behavior if the input is less than the first value in inputRange.
  extrapolateLeft?: Extrapolate.EXTEND | Extrapolate.CLAMP | Extrapolate.IDENTITY,
  // Set the right extrapolate mode, the behavior if the input is greater than the last value in inputRange.
  extrapolateRight?: Extrapolate.EXTEND | Extrapolate.CLAMP | Extrapolate.IDENTITY,
})

Extrapolate.EXTEND; // Will extend the range linearly.
Extrapolate.CLAMP; // Will clamp the input value to the range.
Extrapolate.IDENTITY; // Will return the input value if the input value is out of range.
```

Maps an input value within a range to an output value within a range. Also supports different types of extrapolation for when the value falls outside the range.

---

## `color`

```js
color(red, green, blue, alpha)
```

Creates a color node in RGBA format, where the first three input nodes should have *integer* values in the range 0-255 (consider using `round` node if needed) and correspond to color components Red, Green and Blue respectively. Last input node should have a value between 0 and 1 and represents alpha channel (value `1` means fully opaque and `0` completely transparent). Alpha parameter can be ommited, then `1` (fully opaque) is used as a default.

The returned node can be mapped to view properties that represents color (e.g. [`backgroundColor`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/view-style-props.html#backgroundcolor)).

---

## `concat`

```js
concat(nodeOrValue1, ...)
```

Returns concatanation of given nodes (number or string) as string

---

## `onChange`

```js
onChange(value, action)
```

When evaluated, it will compare `value` to its previous value. If it has changed, `action` will be evaluated and its value will be returned.
